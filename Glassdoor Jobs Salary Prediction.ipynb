        "#### **Introduction**  \n",
        "In today’s fast-paced tech industry, understanding salary trends is essential for job seekers, employers, and policymakers. Compensation varies based on multiple factors such as job role, company size, experience, and location. Analyzing these trends can help professionals make informed decisions regarding their careers while enabling companies to establish competitive salary structures.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This project focuses on predicting salaries for various tech job positions using historical job postings data from Glassdoor (2017-2018). The dataset contains crucial attributes such as job title, company size, location, industry, revenue, and estimated salary, allowing us to build a machine learning model for salary prediction.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Business Objectives**  \n",
        "This project serves multiple stakeholders:  \n",
        "1. **Job Seekers:** Provides insights into expected salary ranges for different roles, helping professionals negotiate better compensation.  \n",
        "2. **Employers:** Assists companies in benchmarking salaries to attract and retain top talent.  \n",
        "3. **Recruiters:** Helps recruitment agencies analyze salary trends across industries and geographies.  \n",
        "4. **Researchers & Analysts:** Offers a data-driven approach to understanding salary distribution and influencing factors.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Problem Statement**  \n",
        "The project aims to answer the following key questions:  \n",
        "- How do salaries vary across different job roles, such as Data Scientist, Software Engineer, and DevOps Engineer?  \n",
        "- What is the impact of company size on salary levels?  \n",
        "- How do salaries differ across locations such as San Francisco, Austin, and New York?  \n",
        "- Can we develop a predictive model to estimate salaries based on job attributes?  \n",
        "\n",
        "By addressing these questions, the project will offer valuable insights into salary distribution patterns and market trends in the tech industry.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Dataset Overview**  \n",
        "The **Glassdoor Jobs Dataset** comprises job postings from 2017-2018, containing attributes such as:  \n",

        "- **Salary Estimate:** Predicted salary range for the role.  \n",
        "- **Company Details:** Name, size, headquarters, industry, type of ownership, year founded.  \n",
        "- **Job Description:** Role-specific details and required skill sets.  \n",
        "- **Location & Revenue:** Impact of location on salaries and the revenue of the company.  \n",
        "- **Competitors & Benefits:** Additional company-related data affecting job appeal.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Machine Learning Approach**  \n",
        "This project follows a supervised machine learning approach using **Linear Regression**, a widely used technique for predicting continuous numerical values like salary.  \n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Steps Involved:**  \n",
        "1. **Data Preprocessing:**  \n",
        "   - Handling missing values.  \n",
        "   - Converting categorical variables into numerical representations.  \n",
        "   - Removing duplicate or irrelevant features.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  \n",
        "   - Identifying correlations between salary and other variables.  \n",
        "   - Creating visualizations (e.g., salary distribution by role, location, and experience).  \n",
        "   - Understanding outliers and anomalies in salary estimates.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Feature Engineering:**  \n",
        "   - Extracting meaningful insights from job descriptions (e.g., required skills, certifications).  \n",
        "   - Creating new variables that might influence salary predictions.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Model Building & Evaluation:**  \n",
        "   - Implementing **Linear Regression** to predict salaries.  \n",
        "   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.  \n",
        "   - Evaluating the model using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  \n",
        "   - Optimizing model performance by adjusting parameters.  \n",
        "   - Testing different regression models (e.g., Ridge, Lasso) for better accuracy.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Libraries & Tools Used**  \n",
        "- **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation and computational efficiency.  \n",
        "- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization (e.g., salary trends, correlation heatmaps).  \n",
        "- **Scikit-learn:** Model training and evaluation.  \n",
        "- **Flask/FastAPI:** Deployment of the predictive model.  \n",
        "- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Hosting the model using **Cloud Functions or AI Platform**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Deployment Strategy on GCP**  \n",
        "To ensure an end-to-end solution, the trained model will be deployed on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** using:  \n",
        "1. **Cloud Storage:** Storing the dataset and trained model.  \n",
        "2. **Cloud Functions/API:** Creating an API endpoint for real-time salary predictions.  \n",
        "3. **Streamlit/Web App:** Providing a user-friendly interface for job seekers to input job details and get salary estimates.  \n",
        "4. **Monitoring & Optimization:** Tracking model performance and refining predictions over time.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Expected Outcomes**  \n",
